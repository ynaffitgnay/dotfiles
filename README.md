This directory contains files that will hopefully ease the process of
maintaining the same development environment across different devices.

This process is kind of hacked together and will hopefully become more
streamlined/ nice over time.

For general setup, you should:
1. Add your bash aliases to your .bashrc
   1. add the following line to the system's .bash_profile if it's not already
      there
      ```
      
      ```
1. Run an ssh-agent in your .bash_profile
